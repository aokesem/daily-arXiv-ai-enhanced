Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: EvoCut提出了一个框架，通过结合大型语言模型和进化搜索算法自动生成加速切割。在实验中表现出比标准整数规划方法更好的性能，降低了优化间隙，更快地获得解决方案并提高了解决方案的质量。该框架无需人为专家输入，能够可靠适用于新实例。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 整数规划是关键的组合优化任务，但由于其NP难性质，仍然具有挑战性。手动设计加速切割是实际解决整数规划问题的有效方法，但这一创造性过程需要深厚的专业知识，并且尚未实现自动化。因此，提出EvoCut框架的动机是自动生成加速切割，提高解析器性能，同时减少人为专家输入。

Method: EvoCut通过结合大型语言模型（LLMs）和进化搜索算法来自动生成加速切割：(i) 通过LLM-based initializer agent初始化候选切割的多样种群；(ii) 对每个切割进行实证评估，评估其保留最优解和在验证集上切断分数解的能力；(iii) 通过进化交叉和变异算法迭代地优化种群。将每个切割的效用量化为在求解器的优化间隙中的相对减少。

Result: EvoCut相对于标准整数规划方法在固定时间内降低了17-57%的优化间隙，更快地获得解决方案，或在相同时间内获得更高质量的解决方案。这一结果表明EvoCut能够有效生成、改进并验证切割，适用于新实例。

Conclusion: EvoCut是一个自动生成加速切割的框架，通过结合大型语言模型和进化搜索算法，能够在固定时间内将整数规划问题的优化间隙降低17-57%。与标准整数规划方法相比，EvoCut能够更快地获得相同解决方案，或在相同时间内获得更高质量的解决方案。该框架不需要人为专家输入，能够可靠生成、改进和经验验证适用于未知实例的切割。

Abstract: Integer programming lies at the heart of crucial combinatorial optimization
tasks but remains challenging due to its NP-hard nature. An effective approach
for practically solving integer programs is the manual design of acceleration
cuts, i.e. inequalities that improve solver performance. However, this creative
process demands deep expertise and is yet to be automated. Our proposed
framework, EvoCut, automates the generation of acceleration cuts by combining
large language models (LLMs) with an evolutionary search. EvoCut (i)
initializes a diverse population of candidate cuts via an LLM-based initializer
agent; (ii) for each cut empirically evaluates both preservation of the optimal
solution and its ability to cut off fractional solutions across a verification
set; and (iii) iteratively refines the population through evolutionary
crossover and mutation agents. We quantify each cut's utility by its relative
reduction in the solver's optimality gap. Our comparisons against standard
integer programming practice show that EvoCut reduces optimality gap by 17-57%
within a fixed time. It obtains the same solutions up to 4 times as fast, and
obtains higher-quality solutions within the same time limit. Requiring no human
expert input, EvoCut reliably generates, improves, and empirically verifies
cuts that generalize to unseen instances. The code is available at

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agent evaluators leverage specialized tools to
ground the rational decision-making of LLMs, making them well-suited to aid in
scientific discoveries, such as constrained retrosynthesis planning.
Constrained retrosynthesis planning is an essential, yet challenging, process
within chemistry for identifying synthetic routes from commercially available
starting materials to desired target molecules, subject to practical

constraint types. LARC achieves a 72.9% success rate on these tasks, vastly
outperforming LLM baselines and approaching human expert-level success in
substantially less time. The LARC framework is extensible, and serves as a
first step towards an effective agentic tool or a co-scientist to human experts
for constrained retrosynthesis.

### [5] [CHBench: A Cognitive Hierarchy Benchmark for Evaluating Strategic Reasoning Capability of LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11944)
*Hongtao Liu,Zhicheng Du,Zihe Wang,Weiran Shen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CHBench, a novel evaluation framework, evaluates LLMs' strategic reasoning with robustness. It analyzes the effects of Chat Mechanism and Memory Mechanism on strategic reasoning performance, offering insights for future research and practical applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing studies on evaluating LLMs' strategic reasoning rely on utility performance metrics, which lack robustness due to variations in opponent behavior and game structure. The paper aims to address this limitation by introducing a novel evaluation framework, CHBench, based on cognitive hierarchy models from behavioral economics.

Method: The paper proposes the Cognitive Hierarchy Benchmark (CHBench) as an evaluation framework inspired by cognitive hierarchy models. It conducts a three-phase systematic evaluation using behavioral data from six LLMs across fifteen normal-form games. The effects of the Chat Mechanism and Memory Mechanism on strategic reasoning performance are analyzed.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that LLMs exhibit consistent strategic reasoning levels across different opponents, confirming the robustness and generalization capability of CHBench. The analysis of the Chat Mechanism and Memory Mechanism shows their respective impacts on strategic reasoning performance.

Conclusion: CHBench is a promising tool for evaluating large language models' strategic reasoning capabilities with robustness and generalization capability. It also provides insights into the effects of Chat Mechanism and Memory Mechanism on strategic reasoning performance, highlighting the potential for future research and practical applications.

Abstract: Game-playing ability serves as an indicator for evaluating the strategic
reasoning capability of large language models (LLMs). While most existing
studies rely on utility performance metrics, which are not robust enough due to
variations in opponent behavior and game structure. To address this limitation,
we propose \textbf{Cognitive Hierarchy Benchmark (CHBench)}, a novel evaluation
framework inspired by the cognitive hierarchy models from behavioral economics.
We hypothesize that agents have bounded rationality -- different agents behave
at varying reasoning depths/levels. We evaluate LLMs' strategic reasoning
through a three-phase systematic framework, utilizing behavioral data from six
state-of-the-art LLMs across fifteen carefully selected normal-form games.
Experiments show that LLMs exhibit consistent strategic reasoning levels across
diverse opponents, confirming the framework's robustness and generalization
capability. We also analyze the effects of two key mechanisms (Chat Mechanism
and Memory Mechanism) on strategic reasoning performance. Results indicate that
the Chat Mechanism significantly degrades strategic reasoning, whereas the
Memory Mechanism enhances it. These insights position CHBench as a promising
tool for evaluating LLM capabilities, with significant potential for future
research and practical applications.

Conclusion: 本文介绍了一种优化数据混合以进行大型语言模型（LLMs）的监督微调（SFT）的方法，旨在最小化验证损失。通过实验验证，我们的算法在所有领域中实现了出色的整体和个体性能。此外，通过我们的方法重新调整流行的SFT数据集，可以改善验证损失和下游性能。最后，我们讨论了如何将我们的方法推广到指导为特定领域模型选择数据，并提供了关于SFT的见解。

Abstract: Optimizing data mixtures for supervised fine-tuning (SFT) of large language
models (LLMs) is critical for developing general-purpose models, yet this area
remains underexplored. In this paper, we frame data mixing as an optimization
problem and introduce a novel method designed to minimize validation loss. Our
approach parametrizes the loss by modeling effective data transferred and
leveraging scaling laws for fine-tuning. By experimenting with various
small-scale data mixtures, we fit these parameters and derive the optimal
weights. We provide both mathematical proofs and empirical results
demonstrating that our algorithm achieves excellent overall and individual
performance across all domains. Through controlled experiments, we show that
models trained with our optimized weights perform on par with those using
optimal weights determined via grid search, with per-domain loss only 0.66%
higher than the best domain loss from grid search on average. Additionally, we
show that reweighting popular SFT datasets using our method improves both
validation loss and downstream performance. Finally, we discuss how our method
can generalize to guide data selection for domain-specific models and provide
insights into SFT.

### [7] [UniCast: A Unified Multimodal Prompting Framework for Time Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11954)
*Sehyuk Park,Soyeon Caren Han,Eduard Hovy*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: UniCast is a novel multimodal framework that enhances forecasting performance by incorporating vision, text, and time series data. It outperforms existing TSFM models through efficient adaptation with minimal parameter updates and effective cross-modal interaction, highlighting the significance of multimodal context in improving general-purpose time series forecasters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recent advances in TSFMs have shown strong generalization through large-scale pretraining but lack consideration for multimodal context present in real-world time series data. This paper addresses this gap by introducing a parameter-efficient framework, UniCast, to enhance forecasting performance by incorporating visual and textual signals in addition to time series data.

Method: Introducing UniCast, a framework that extends TSFMs to incorporate multimodal context by jointly leveraging time series, vision, and text data. The method integrates pretrained Vision and Text Encoders with a frozen TSFM through soft prompt tuning for efficient adaptation and cross-modal interaction.

Result: Extensive experiments on diverse time-series forecasting benchmarks demonstrate that UniCast consistently outperforms existing TSFM baselines, showcasing the importance of multimodal context in improving general-purpose time series forecasters.

Conclusion: UniCast, a novel parameter-efficient multimodal framework, outperforms existing Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) in forecasting performance by leveraging time series, vision, and text modalities. The integration of modality-specific embeddings and soft prompt tuning enables efficient adaptation with minimal parameter updates and effective cross-modal interaction.

Abstract: Time series forecasting is a foundational task across domains, such as
finance, healthcare, and environmental monitoring. While recent advances in
Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) have demonstrated strong generalisation
through large-scale pretraining, existing models operate predominantly in a
unimodal setting, ignoring the rich multimodal context, such as visual and
textual signals, that often accompanies time series data in real-world
scenarios. This paper introduces a novel parameter-efficient multimodal
framework, UniCast, that extends TSFMs to jointly leverage time series, vision,
and text modalities for enhanced forecasting performance. Our method integrates
modality-specific embeddings from pretrained Vision and Text Encoders with a
frozen TSFM via soft prompt tuning, enabling efficient adaptation with minimal
parameter updates. This design not only preserves the generalisation strength
of the foundation model but also enables effective cross-modal interaction.
Extensive experiments across diverse time-series forecasting benchmarks
demonstrate that UniCast consistently and significantly outperforms all
existing TSFM baselines. The findings highlight the critical role of multimodal
context in advancing the next generation of general-purpose time series
forecasters.

Abstract: Feature attribution methods based on game theory are ubiquitous in the field
of eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI). Recent works proposed rigorous
feature attribution using logic-based explanations, specifically targeting
high-stakes uses of machine learning (ML) models. Typically, such works exploit
weak abductive explanation (WAXp) as the characteristic function to assign
importance to features. However, one possible downside is that the contribution
of non-WAXp sets is neglected. In fact, non-WAXp sets can also convey important
information, because of the relationship between formal explanations (XPs) and
adversarial examples (AExs). Accordingly, this paper leverages Shapley value
and Banzhaf index to devise two novel feature importance scores. We take into
account non-WAXp sets when computing feature contribution, and the novel scores
quantify how effective each feature is at excluding AExs. Furthermore, the
paper identifies properties and studies the computational complexity of the
proposed scores.

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) often struggle with chart understanding tasks,
particularly in accurate chart description and complex reasoning. Synthetic
data generation is a promising solution, while usually facing the challenge of
noise labels. To address this challenge, we first introduce a chart synthesis
pipeline that generates aligned chart-question-answer triplets through code
generation and execution, ensuring the reliability of synthetic data without
human intervention. Furthermore, inspired by test-time scaling that increases
inference budget and thereby improves performance, we design a
candidate-conditioned answering process. The VLM first generates multiple
responses per query, and then synthesizes the final answer by contextualizing
these candidates. Experiments demonstrate significant improvements, with up to
15.50 points accuracy gain over the initial VLM, in a fully self-improving
paradigm without either human-labeled data or external models.

Abstract: Future prediction is a complex task for LLM agents, requiring a high level of
analytical thinking, information gathering, contextual understanding, and
decision-making under uncertainty. Agents must not only gather and interpret
vast amounts of dynamic information but also integrate diverse data sources,
weigh uncertainties, and adapt predictions based on emerging trends, just as
human experts do in fields like politics, economics, and finance. Despite its
importance, no large-scale benchmark exists for evaluating agents on future
prediction, largely due to challenges in handling real-time updates and
retrieving timely, accurate answers. To address this, we introduce
$\textbf{FutureX}$, a dynamic and live evaluation benchmark specifically
designed for LLM agents performing future prediction tasks. FutureX is the
largest and most diverse live benchmark for future prediction, supporting
real-time daily updates and eliminating data contamination through an automated
pipeline for question gathering and answer collection. We evaluate 25 LLM/agent
models, including those with reasoning, search capabilities, and integration of
external tools such as the open-source Deep Research Agent and closed-source
Deep Research models. This comprehensive evaluation assesses agents' adaptive
reasoning and performance in dynamic environments. Additionally, we provide
in-depth analyses of agents' failure modes and performance pitfalls in
future-oriented tasks, including the vulnerability to fake web pages and the
temporal validity. Our goal is to establish a dynamic, contamination-free
evaluation standard that drives the development of LLM agents capable of
performing at the level of professional human analysts in complex reasoning and
predictive thinking.

*Weihao Sun*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了AIGer方法，通过节点逻辑特征初始化和AIGs特征学习网络两个组件，提升了对AIGs的功能和结构特征联合建模能力，改进了信息传递能力，并在实验中取得了比当前最佳模型更好的结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于真实AIGs的复杂结构和大规模节点，准确建模具有挑战性，现有工作缺乏联合建模功能和结构特征的能力，以及动态信息传播能力不足。因此，提出AIGer以解决这些挑战。

Method: AIGer方法包括两个组件：1）节点逻辑特征初始化嵌入组件和2）AIGs特征学习网络组件。节点逻辑特征初始化嵌入组件将逻辑节点投影到独立的语义空间，以便进行后续处理。AIGs特征学习网络组件则利用异构图卷积网络，设计动态关系权重矩阵和不同的信息聚合方法，以更好地表示AIGs的原始结构和信息。

Result: 实验结果表明，AIGer在Signal Probability Prediction（SSP）任务中将MAE和MSE提高了18.95％和44.44％，在Truth Table Distance Prediction（TTDP）任务中将MAE和MSE分别提高了33.57％和14.79％。

Conclusion: 提出了一种名为AIGer的方法，通过两个组件实现了对AND-Inverter Graphs（AIGs）的功能和结构特征的联合建模，改进了信息传递能力，并在Signal Probability Prediction（SSP）和Truth Table Distance Prediction（TTDP）任务中优于当前最佳模型。

Abstract: The automation of logic circuit design enhances chip performance, energy
efficiency, and reliability, and is widely applied in the field of Electronic
Design Automation (EDA).And-Inverter Graphs (AIGs) efficiently represent,
optimize, and verify the functional characteristics of digital circuits,
enhancing the efficiency of EDA development.Due to the complex structure and
large scale of nodes in real-world AIGs, accurate modeling is challenging,
leading to existing work lacking the ability to jointly model functional and
structural characteristics, as well as insufficient dynamic information
propagation capability.To address the aforementioned challenges, we propose
AIGer.Specifically, AIGer consists of two components: 1) Node logic feature
initialization embedding component and 2) AIGs feature learning network
component.The node logic feature initialization embedding component projects
logic nodes, such as AND and NOT, into independent semantic spaces, to enable
effective node embedding for subsequent processing.Building upon this, the AIGs
feature learning network component employs a heterogeneous graph convolutional
network, designing dynamic relationship weight matrices and differentiated
information aggregation approaches to better represent the original structure
and information of AIGs.The combination of these two components enhances
AIGer's ability to jointly model functional and structural characteristics and
improves its message passing capability. Experimental results indicate that
AIGer outperforms the current best models in the Signal Probability Prediction
(SSP) task, improving MAE and MSE by 18.95\% and 44.44\%, respectively. In the
Truth Table Distance Prediction (TTDP) task, AIGer achieves improvements of
33.57\% and 14.79\% in MAE and MSE, respectively, compared to the
best-performing models.

Conclusion: AgentCDM提出的结构化框架在LLM驱动的多代理系统中显著改进了协作决策的质量和鲁棒性，实现了最先进的性能表现和强大的泛化能力。

Abstract: Multi-agent systems (MAS) powered by large language models (LLMs) hold
significant promise for solving complex decision-making tasks. However, the
core process of collaborative decision-making (CDM) within these systems
remains underexplored. Existing approaches often rely on either ``dictatorial"
strategies that are vulnerable to the cognitive biases of a single agent, or
``voting-based" methods that fail to fully harness collective intelligence. To
address these limitations, we propose \textbf{AgentCDM}, a structured framework
for enhancing collaborative decision-making in LLM-based multi-agent systems.
Drawing inspiration from the Analysis of Competing Hypotheses (ACH) in
cognitive science, AgentCDM introduces a structured reasoning paradigm that
systematically mitigates cognitive biases and shifts decision-making from
passive answer selection to active hypothesis evaluation and construction. To
internalize this reasoning process, we develop a two-stage training paradigm:
the first stage uses explicit ACH-inspired scaffolding to guide the model
through structured reasoning, while the second stage progressively removes this
scaffolding to encourage autonomous generalization. Experiments on multiple
benchmark datasets demonstrate that AgentCDM achieves state-of-the-art
performance and exhibits strong generalization, validating its effectiveness in
improving the quality and robustness of collaborative decisions in MAS.

Abstract: Major Depressive Disorder is one of the leading causes of disability
worldwide, yet its diagnosis still depends largely on subjective clinical
assessments. Integrating Artificial Intelligence (AI) holds promise for
developing objective, scalable, and timely diagnostic tools. In this paper, we
present a comprehensive survey of state-of-the-art AI methods for depression
detection and diagnosis, based on a systematic review of 55 key studies. We
introduce a novel hierarchical taxonomy that structures the field by primary
clinical task (diagnosis vs. prediction), data modality (text, speech,
neuroimaging, multimodal), and computational model class (e.g., graph neural
networks, large language models, hybrid approaches). Our in-depth analysis
reveals three major trends: the predominance of graph neural networks for
modeling brain connectivity, the rise of large language models for linguistic
and conversational data, and an emerging focus on multimodal fusion,
explainability, and algorithmic fairness. Alongside methodological insights, we
provide an overview of prominent public datasets and standard evaluation
metrics as a practical guide for researchers. By synthesizing current advances
and highlighting open challenges, this survey offers a comprehensive roadmap
for future innovation in computational psychiatry.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该研究介绍了 Bongard-RWR+ 数据集，利用视觉语言模型生成类似真实世界的图像，用于表示原始 Bongard Problems 的抽象概念。评估了最先进的视觉语言模型在不同 Bongard Problems 表述下的表现，发现它们在辨别细粒度概念时存在挑战，显示了它们的推理能力限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 起初的 Bongard Problems 基准测试采用合成的黑白图像，不能完全捕捉现实场景的复杂性。后续的数据集虽然采用真实世界图像，但所代表的概念是可从高级图像特征中识别的，降低了任务复杂度。因此，需要一个能够使用细粒度真实世界图像来表示抽象概念的数据集。

Method: 通过构建 Bongard-RWR+ 数据集，使用视觉语言模型生成类似真实世界的图像来表示原始 Bongard Problems 的抽象概念。利用 Pixtral-12B 描述手动策划的图像并生成与基础概念一致的新描述，使用 Flux.1-dev 合成这些描述的图像，并手动验证生成的图像是否忠实地反映了预期概念。在不同的 Bongard Problems 表述中评估最先进的视觉语言模型，包括二元和多类分类，以及文本答案生成。

Result: 通过评估 VLM 在不同 Bongard Problems 表述中的表现，发现它们在识别粗粒度视觉概念方面表现良好，但在辨别细粒度概念时存在困难。

Conclusion: 该研究表明虽然视觉语言模型可以识别粗粒度的视觉概念，但在辨别细粒度概念时一直存在困难，突显了它们推理能力的局限性。

Abstract: Bongard Problems (BPs) provide a challenging testbed for abstract visual
reasoning (AVR), requiring models to identify visual concepts fromjust a few
examples and describe them in natural language. Early BP benchmarks featured
synthetic black-and-white drawings, which might not fully capture the
complexity of real-world scenes. Subsequent BP datasets employed real-world
images, albeit the represented concepts are identifiable from high-level image
features, reducing the task complexity. Differently, the recently released
Bongard-RWR dataset aimed at representing abstract concepts formulated in the
original BPs using fine-grained real-world images. Its manual construction,
however, limited the dataset size to just $60$ instances, constraining
evaluation robustness. In this work, we introduce Bongard-RWR+, a BP dataset
composed of $5\,400$ instances that represent original BP abstract concepts
using real-world-like images generated via a vision language model (VLM)
pipeline. Building on Bongard-RWR, we employ Pixtral-12B to describe manually
curated images and generate new descriptions aligned with the underlying
concepts, use Flux.1-dev to synthesize images from these descriptions, and
manually verify that the generated images faithfully reflect the intended
concepts. We evaluate state-of-the-art VLMs across diverse BP formulations,
including binary and multiclass classification, as well as textual answer
generation. Our findings reveal that while VLMs can recognize coarse-grained
visual concepts, they consistently struggle with discerning fine-grained
concepts, highlighting limitations in their reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Active inference is a formal approach to study cognition based on the notion
that adaptive agents can be seen as engaging in a process of approximate
Bayesian inference, via the minimisation of variational and expected free
energies. Minimising the former provides an account of perceptual processes and
learning as evidence accumulation, while minimising the latter describes how
agents select their actions over time. In this way, adaptive agents are able to
maximise the likelihood of preferred observations or states, given a generative
model of the environment. In the literature, however, different strategies have
been proposed to describe how agents can plan their future actions. While they
all share the notion that some kind of expected free energy offers an
appropriate way to score policies, sequences of actions, in terms of their
desirability, there are different ways to consider the contribution of past
motor experience to the agent's future behaviour. In some approaches, agents
are assumed to know their own actions, and use such knowledge to better plan
for the future. In other approaches, agents are unaware of their actions, and
must infer their motor behaviour from recent observations in order to plan for
the future. This difference reflects a standard point of departure in two
leading frameworks in motor control based on the presence, or not, of an
efference copy signal representing knowledge about an agent's own actions. In
this work we compare the performances of action-aware and action-unaware agents
in two navigations tasks, showing how action-unaware agents can achieve
performances comparable to action-aware ones while at a severe disadvantage.

Motivation: 现有的分散式可学习求解器在处理大规模MAPF问题时表现出很大的潜力，尤其是在利用基础模型和大型数据集时。然而，这些智能体是反应性策略模型，对环境时间动态和智能体依赖性的建模有限，在复杂的长期规划场景中表现出性能下降。因此，为了解决这些限制，提出了MAPF-World，旨在通过引入环境动态建模和未来状态预测来改进MAPF问题的决策制定。

Abstract: Multi-agent path finding (MAPF) is the problem of planning conflict-free
paths from the designated start locations to goal positions for multiple
agents. It underlies a variety of real-world tasks, including multi-robot
coordination, robot-assisted logistics, and social navigation. Recent
decentralized learnable solvers have shown great promise for large-scale MAPF,
especially when leveraging foundation models and large datasets. However, these
agents are reactive policy models and exhibit limited modeling of environmental
temporal dynamics and inter-agent dependencies, resulting in performance
degradation in complex, long-term planning scenarios. To address these
limitations, we propose MAPF-World, an autoregressive action world model for
MAPF that unifies situation understanding and action generation, guiding
decisions beyond immediate local observations. It improves situational
awareness by explicitly modeling environmental dynamics, including spatial
features and temporal dependencies, through future state and actions
prediction. By incorporating these predicted futures, MAPF-World enables more
informed, coordinated, and far-sighted decision-making, especially in complex
multi-agent settings. Furthermore, we augment MAPF benchmarks by introducing an
automatic map generator grounded in real-world scenarios, capturing practical
map layouts for training and evaluating MAPF solvers. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that MAPF-World outperforms state-of-the-art learnable solvers,
showcasing superior zero-shot generalization to out-of-distribution cases.
Notably, MAPF-World is trained with a 96.5% smaller model size and 92% reduced
data.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个两阶段推理线程评估框架ReT-Eval，通过从领域知识图中提取语义相关知识并应用大型语言模型知识消除差异，结合奖励引导策略评估和修剪推理线程，以增强用户理解和提高推理效果。实验证明其优于现有的推理模型。

Method: 该论文采用了两阶段的推理线程评估框架，第一阶段利用图神经网络从稀疏领域知识图中提取语义相关的知识结构，并结合大型语言模型知识来消除知识差异；第二阶段通过奖励引导策略评估和修剪这些线程，以保持语义连贯性生成有效的推理线程。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种基于人类推理策略、结构化知识复用的两阶段推理线程评估框架ReT-Eval，旨在解决当前推理模型的局限性，提高推理效果。实验证明ReT-Eval能够增强用户理解，并优于目前的推理模型。

Abstract: Reasoning in interactive problem solving scenarios requires models to
construct reasoning threads that reflect user understanding and align with
structured domain knowledge. However, current reasoning models often lack
explicit semantic hierarchies, user-domain knowledge alignment, and principled
mechanisms to prune reasoning threads for effectiveness. These limitations
result in lengthy generic output that does not guide users through
goal-oriented reasoning steps. To address this, we propose a
prototype-inspired, two-phases Reasoning-Threads-Evaluation (ReT-Eval)
framework, drawing inspiration from human-like reasoning strategies that
emphasize structured knowledge reuse. In the first phase, semantically relevant
knowledge structures are extracted from a sparse domain knowledge graph using a
graph neural network and enriched with intrinsic large language model knowledge
to resolve knowledge discrepancies. In the second phase, these threads are
evaluated and pruned using a reward-guided strategy aimed at maintaining
semantic coherence to generate effective reasoning threads. Experiments and
expert evaluations show that ReT-Eval enhances user understanding and
outperforms state-of-the-art reasoning models.

TL;DR: MOVER framework enhances multimodal learning by combining optimal transport-based alignment and geometric volume minimization, outperforming existing methods in text-video-audio retrieval tasks with improved generalization and structural consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal learning approaches struggle to generalize across multiple modalities and lack semantic structure in high-dimensional spaces.

Method: Propose MOVER, a framework combining optimal transport-based soft alignment and geometric volume minimization to build semantically aligned multimodal representations.

Result: Experiments show that MOVER outperforms previous methods in zero-shot and finetuned settings, with improved generalization to unseen modality combinations and stronger structural consistency in the learned embedding space.

Conclusion: MOVER framework significantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods in text-video-audio retrieval tasks, demonstrating improved generalization and stronger structural consistency in learned embeddings.

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal learning have largely relied on pairwise
contrastive objectives to align different modalities, such as text, video, and
audio, in a shared embedding space. While effective in bi-modal setups, these
approaches struggle to generalize across multiple modalities and often lack
semantic structure in high-dimensional spaces. In this paper, we propose MOVER,
a novel framework that combines optimal transport-based soft alignment with
volume-based geometric regularization to build semantically aligned and
structured multimodal representations. By integrating a transport-guided
matching mechanism with a geometric volume minimization objective (GAVE), MOVER
encourages consistent alignment across all modalities in a modality-agnostic
manner. Experiments on text-video-audio retrieval tasks demonstrate that MOVER
significantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods in both zero-shot and
finetuned settings. Additional analysis shows improved generalization to unseen
modality combinations and stronger structural consistency in the learned
embedding space.

Abstract: This paper introduces RLNVR (Reinforcement Learning from Non-Verified
Rewards), a framework for training language models using noisy, real-world
feedback signals without requiring explicit human verification. Traditional
RLHF requires expensive, verified reward signals that are impractical in many
real-world domains. RLNVR addresses this challenge through baseline
normalization and semantic similarity-based reward transfer. We demonstrate
RLNVR through Walter, a prototype system that optimizes social media content
generation using actual engagement data from Bluesky. Our experimental results
show significant improvements in content quality and training stability, with
comprehensive evaluation planned for future work. Positioning: We present a
practical framework that combines RLNVR with GSPO (Group Sequence Policy
Optimization) and an optional UED (Unsupervised Environment Design) curriculum
to improve stability and diversity under noisy, implicit rewards. To our
knowledge, combining GSPO-style normalization with a UED-style curriculum for
LLM content generation from implicit social engagement has not been previously
documented in this applied setting; we frame this as an applied integration
rather than a new algorithm.

Conclusion: RadarQA outperforms existing general MLLMs in weather forecast quality analysis, showing potential for advancing weather prediction quality analysis.

Abstract: Quality analysis of weather forecasts is an essential topic in meteorology.
Although traditional score-based evaluation metrics can quantify certain
forecast errors, they are still far from meteorological experts in terms of
descriptive capability, interpretability, and understanding of dynamic
evolution. With the rapid development of Multi-modal Large Language Models
(MLLMs), these models become potential tools to overcome the above challenges.
In this work, we introduce an MLLM-based weather forecast analysis method,
RadarQA, integrating key physical attributes with detailed assessment reports.
We introduce a novel and comprehensive task paradigm for multi-modal quality
analysis, encompassing both single frame and sequence, under both rating and
assessment scenarios. To support training and benchmarking, we design a hybrid
annotation pipeline that combines human expert labeling with automated
heuristics. With such an annotation method, we construct RQA-70K, a large-scale
dataset with varying difficulty levels for radar forecast quality evaluation.
We further design a multi-stage training strategy that iteratively improves
model performance at each stage. Extensive experiments show that RadarQA
outperforms existing general MLLMs across all evaluation settings, highlighting
its potential for advancing quality analysis in weather prediction.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has significantly enhanced the reasoning
capabilities of large language models (LLMs), but its reliance on expensive
human-labeled data or complex reward models severely limits scalability. While
existing self-feedback methods aim to address this problem, they are
constrained by the capabilities of a single model, which can lead to
overconfidence in incorrect answers, reward hacking, and even training
collapse. To this end, we propose Reinforcement Learning from Coevolutionary
Collective Feedback (RLCCF), a novel RL framework that enables multi-model
collaborative evolution without external supervision. Specifically, RLCCF
optimizes the ability of a model collective by maximizing its Collective
Consistency (CC), which jointly trains a diverse ensemble of LLMs and provides
reward signals by voting on collective outputs. Moreover, each model's vote is
weighted by its Self-Consistency (SC) score, ensuring that more confident
models contribute more to the collective decision. Benefiting from the diverse
output distributions and complementary abilities of multiple LLMs, RLCCF
enables the model collective to continuously enhance its reasoning ability
through coevolution. Experiments on four mainstream open-source LLMs across
four mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that our framework yields
significant performance gains, achieving an average relative improvement of
16.72\% in accuracy. Notably, RLCCF not only improves the performance of
individual models but also enhances the group's majority-voting accuracy by
4.51\%, demonstrating its ability to extend the collective capability boundary
of the model collective.

Abstract: Fault intensity diagnosis (FID) plays a pivotal role in monitoring and
maintaining mechanical devices within complex industrial systems. As current
FID methods are based on chain of thought without considering dependencies
among target classes. To capture and explore dependencies, we propose a
hierarchical knowledge guided fault intensity diagnosis framework (HKG)
inspired by the tree of thought, which is amenable to any representation
learning methods. The HKG uses graph convolutional networks to map the
hierarchical topological graph of class representations into a set of
interdependent global hierarchical classifiers, where each node is denoted by
word embeddings of a class. These global hierarchical classifiers are applied
to learned deep features extracted by representation learning, allowing the
entire model to be end-to-end learnable. In addition, we develop a re-weighted
hierarchical knowledge correlation matrix (Re-HKCM) scheme by embedding
inter-class hierarchical knowledge into a data-driven statistical correlation
matrix (SCM) which effectively guides the information sharing of nodes in
graphical convolutional neural networks and avoids over-smoothing issues. The
Re-HKCM is derived from the SCM through a series of mathematical
transformations. Extensive experiments are performed on four real-world
datasets from different industrial domains (three cavitation datasets from
SAMSON AG and one existing publicly) for FID, all showing superior results and
outperform recent state-of-the-art FID methods.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GraphCogent is a framework that improves large language models' graph reasoning by decomposing tasks into specialized cognitive processes. It outperforms existing benchmarks and achieves a 50% improvement over massive-scale LLMs. The framework reduces token usage significantly for different tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models struggle with real-world graphs due to their inability to effectively process complex graph topology and perform multi-step reasoning. The motivation behind this work is to address these limitations by introducing a collaborative agent framework that mimics human working memory for efficient graph reasoning.

Method: The paper proposes GraphCogent, which decomposes graph reasoning into specialized cognitive processes: sense, buffer, and execute. It consists of three modules: Sensory Module, Buffer Module, and Execution Module, each handling different aspects of graph reasoning. Additionally, the paper introduces Graph4real, a comprehensive benchmark containing real-world graphs from four domains to evaluate LLMs' graph reasoning abilities.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that GraphCogent based on Llama3.1-8B outperforms massive-scale LLMs like DeepSeek-R1 by 50% and state-of-the-art agent-based baseline by 20% in accuracy, with significant reductions in token usage for both in-toolset and out-toolset tasks.

Conclusion: GraphCogent, a collaborative agent framework inspired by human Working Memory Model, improves the graph reasoning capabilities of large language models significantly. It outperforms existing benchmarks and achieves a 50% improvement over massive-scale LLMs like DeepSeek-R1 (671B), with reduced token usage for in-toolset and out-toolset tasks.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show promising performance on small-scale graph
reasoning tasks but fail when handling real-world graphs with complex queries.
This phenomenon stems from LLMs' inability to effectively process complex graph
topology and perform multi-step reasoning simultaneously. To address these
limitations, we propose GraphCogent, a collaborative agent framework inspired
by human Working Memory Model that decomposes graph reasoning into specialized
cognitive processes: sense, buffer, and execute. The framework consists of
three modules: Sensory Module standardizes diverse graph text representations
via subgraph sampling, Buffer Module integrates and indexes graph data across
multiple formats, and Execution Module combines tool calling and model
generation for efficient reasoning. We also introduce Graph4real, a
comprehensive benchmark contains with four domains of real-world graphs (Web,
Social, Transportation, and Citation) to evaluate LLMs' graph reasoning
capabilities. Our Graph4real covers 21 different graph reasoning tasks,
categorized into three types (Structural Querying, Algorithmic Reasoning, and
Predictive Modeling tasks), with graph scales that are 10 times larger than
existing benchmarks. Experiments show that Llama3.1-8B based GraphCogent
achieves a 50% improvement over massive-scale LLMs like DeepSeek-R1 (671B).
Compared to state-of-the-art agent-based baseline, our framework outperforms by
20% in accuracy while reducing token usage by 80% for in-toolset tasks and 30%
for out-toolset tasks. Code will be available after review.

*Phuong Minh Nguyen,Tien Huu Dang,Naoya Inoue*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了Symbolic-Aided Chain-of-Thought（CoT）方法，通过整合轻量级符号表示到少样本提示中，改进了大语言模型的逻辑推理能力。实验证明在复杂推理任务中表现优异，提高了模型的透明性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准CoT存在的问题是在逻辑推理中缺乏透明性和可解释性，本文旨在改进这一点。现有研究对于LLM逻辑推理的处理仍有提升空间，因此提出了结合符号表示的改进方法来增强推理过程的透明性和效果性。

Method: 将轻量级符号表示整合到少样本提示中，采用一致的策略结构化推理步骤，使得推理模式更加显式化。通过这种方式增强了LLM逻辑推理的透明性、可解释性和可分析性。在多个逻辑推理基准测试上进行了实验验证，证明了该方法在复杂推理任务中的有效性。

Result: 实验证明，通过引入符号结构，Symbolic-Aided CoT在复杂推理任务中表现优异，提升了LLM的推理能力。在四个不同数据集上，该方法明显优于传统的CoT，在三个数据集上表现特别突出。

Conclusion: 提出了一种名为Symbolic-Aided Chain-of-Thought（CoT）的改进方法，用于逻辑推理任务。通过将轻量级符号表示整合到少样本提示中，结构化推理步骤并采用一致的策略，使得推理模式在非迭代推理过程中更加显式。通过整合这些符号结构，该方法在保持标准提示技术的泛化能力的同时，增强了LLM逻辑推理的透明性、可解释性和可分析性。在四个著名的逻辑推理基准测试上进行了大量实验，包括ProofWriter、FOLIO、ProntoQA和LogicalDeduction，涵盖了多样化的推理场景，证明了所提方法的有效性，特别是在需要处理多个约束或规则的复杂推理任务方面表现突出。值得注意的是，Symbolic-Aided CoT 在各种模型大小上持续提升了LLM的推理能力，并在四个数据集中的三个ProofWriter、ProntoQA和LogicalDeduction上明显优于传统的CoT。

Abstract: This work introduces Symbolic-Aided Chain-of-Thought (CoT), an improved
approach to standard CoT, for logical reasoning in large language models
(LLMs). The key idea is to integrate lightweight symbolic representations into
few-shot prompts, structuring the inference steps with a consistent strategy to
make reasoning patterns more explicit within a non-iterative reasoning process.
By incorporating these symbolic structures, our method preserves the
generalizability of standard prompting techniques while enhancing the
transparency, interpretability, and analyzability of LLM logical reasoning.
Extensive experiments on four well-known logical reasoning benchmarks --
ProofWriter, FOLIO, ProntoQA, and LogicalDeduction, which cover diverse
reasoning scenarios -- demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach,
particularly in complex reasoning tasks that require navigating multiple
constraints or rules. Notably, Symbolic-Aided CoT consistently improves LLMs'
reasoning capabilities across various model sizes and significantly outperforms
conventional CoT on three out of four datasets, ProofWriter, ProntoQA, and
LogicalDeduction.

Abstract: Root cause analysis (RCA) in microservice systems is challenging, requiring
on-call engineers to rapidly diagnose failures across heterogeneous telemetry
such as metrics, logs, and traces. Traditional RCA methods often focus on
single modalities or merely rank suspect services, falling short of providing
actionable diagnostic insights with remediation guidance. This paper introduces
GALA, a novel multi-modal framework that combines statistical causal inference
with LLM-driven iterative reasoning for enhanced RCA. Evaluated on an
open-source benchmark, GALA achieves substantial improvements over
state-of-the-art methods of up to 42.22% accuracy. Our novel human-guided LLM
evaluation score shows GALA generates significantly more causally sound and
actionable diagnostic outputs than existing methods. Through comprehensive
experiments and a case study, we show that GALA bridges the gap between
automated failure diagnosis and practical incident resolution by providing both
accurate root cause identification and human-interpretable remediation
guidance.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究聚焦于Yokai Learning Environment（YLE），为多智能体强化学习环境，挑战了ToM基准，并揭示了RL代理在建立和维护共同基础方面的困难。代理在YLE中表现不佳，即使具有完美记忆；信念建模提高性能但仍有局限，无法有效推广或在较长游戏中形成准确信念。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的Theory of Mind（ToM）基准受限于被动观察者设置或缺乏对代理如何建立和维护共同基础的评估。为了解决这些问题，引入了Yokai Learning Environment（YLE），旨在提供更具挑战性的环境，以评估代理在建立和维护共同基础方面的表现。

Method: 引入了Yokai Learning Environment（YLE）作为多智能体强化学习（RL）环境，基于合作性卡牌游戏Yokai。在YLE中，代理轮流观看隐藏的卡片并移动它们以根据颜色形成群。成功需要跟踪不断变化的信念，记住过去的观察，使用提示作为基于传地通信，并与队友保持共同基础。

Result: 在评估中发现，当前的RL代理在YLE中难以解决问题，即使具有完美记忆的能力。信念建模可以改善性能，但代理仍然无法很好地推广到未知伙伴或在较长游戏中形成准确的信念。

Conclusion: 研究发现当前的强化学习代理在 Yokai Learning Environment（YLE）中表现不佳，即使具有完美记忆的能力。另外，尽管信念建模可以提升性能，但代理仍然无法有效地推广到未知伙伴或在较长的游戏中形成准确的信念，暴露出对脆弱惯例而非强大信念跟踪的依赖。研究使用YLE探讨了信念建模、记忆、伙伴概括以及扩展到更高阶ToM的研究问题。

Abstract: Developing collaborative AI hinges on Theory of Mind (ToM) - the ability to
reason about the beliefs of others to build and maintain common ground.
Existing ToM benchmarks, however, are restricted to passive observer settings
or lack an assessment of how agents establish and maintain common ground over
time. To address these gaps, we introduce the Yokai Learning Environment (YLE)
- a multi-agent reinforcement learning (RL) environment based on the
cooperative card game Yokai. In the YLE, agents take turns peeking at hidden
cards and moving them to form clusters based on colour. Success requires
tracking evolving beliefs, remembering past observations, using hints as
grounded communication, and maintaining common ground with teammates. Our
evaluation yields two key findings: First, current RL agents struggle to solve
the YLE, even when given access to perfect memory. Second, while belief
modelling improves performance, agents are still unable to effectively
generalise to unseen partners or form accurate beliefs over longer games,
exposing a reliance on brittle conventions rather than robust belief tracking.
We use the YLE to investigate research questions in belief modelling, memory,
partner generalisation, and scaling to higher-order ToM.

Abstract: Molecular dynamics simulations (MDS) face challenges, including
resource-heavy computations and the need to manually scan outputs to detect
"interesting events," such as the formation and persistence of hydrogen bonds
between atoms of different molecules. A critical research gap lies in
identifying the underlying causes of hydrogen bond formation and separation
-understanding which interactions or prior events contribute to their emergence
over time. With this challenge in mind, we propose leveraging spatio-temporal
data analytics and machine learning models to enhance the detection of these
phenomena. In this paper, our approach is inspired by causal modeling and aims
to identify the root cause variables of hydrogen bond formation and separation
events. Specifically, we treat the separation of hydrogen bonds as an
"intervention" occurring and represent the causal structure of the bonding and
separation events in the MDS as graphical causal models. These causal models
are built using a variational autoencoder-inspired architecture that enables us
to infer causal relationships across samples with diverse underlying causal
graphs while leveraging shared dynamic information. We further include a step
to infer the root causes of changes in the joint distribution of the causal
models. By constructing causal models that capture shifts in the conditional
distributions of molecular interactions during bond formation or separation,
this framework provides a novel perspective on root cause analysis in molecular
dynamic systems. We validate the efficacy of our model empirically on the
atomic trajectories that used MDS for chiral separation, demonstrating that we
can predict many steps in the future and also find the variables driving the
observed changes in the system.

Abstract: Joint entity-relation extraction (JERE) identifies both entities and their
relationships simultaneously. Traditional machine-learning based approaches to
performing this task require a large corpus of annotated data and lack the
ability to easily incorporate domain specific information in the construction
of the model. Therefore, creating a model for JERE is often labor intensive,
time consuming, and elaboration intolerant. In this paper, we propose
harnessing the capabilities of generative pretrained large language models
(LLMs) and the knowledge representation and reasoning capabilities of Answer
Set Programming (ASP) to perform JERE. We present a generic workflow for JERE
using LLMs and ASP. The workflow is generic in the sense that it can be applied
for JERE in any domain. It takes advantage of LLM's capability in natural
language understanding in that it works directly with unannotated text. It
exploits the elaboration tolerant feature of ASP in that no modification of its
core program is required when additional domain specific knowledge, in the form
of type specifications, is found and needs to be used. We demonstrate the
usefulness of the proposed workflow through experiments with limited training
data on three well-known benchmarks for JERE. The results of our experiments
show that the LLM + ASP workflow is better than state-of-the-art JERE systems
in several categories with only 10\% of training data. It is able to achieve a
2.5 times (35\% over 15\%) improvement in the Relation Extraction task for the
SciERC corpus, one of the most difficult benchmarks.

Abstract: Cognitive structure is a student's subjective organization of an objective
knowledge system, reflected in the psychological construction of concepts and
their relations. However, cognitive structure assessment remains a
long-standing challenge in student modeling and psychometrics, persisting as a
foundational yet largely unassessable concept in educational practice. This
paper introduces a novel framework, Cognitive Structure Generation (CSG), in
which we first pretrain a Cognitive Structure Diffusion Probabilistic Model
(CSDPM) to generate students' cognitive structures from educational priors, and
then further optimize its generative process as a policy with hierarchical
reward signals via reinforcement learning to align with genuine cognitive
development levels during students' learning processes. Experimental results on
four popular real-world education datasets show that cognitive structures
generated by CSG offer more comprehensive and effective representations for
student modeling, substantially improving performance on KT and CD tasks while
enhancing interpretability.

Abstract: As urban aerial mobility (UAM) infrastructure development accelerates
globally, cities like Shenzhen are planning large-scale vertiport networks
(e.g., 1,200+ facilities by 2026). Existing planning frameworks remain
inadequate for this complexity due to historical limitations in data
granularity and real-world applicability. This paper addresses these gaps by
first proposing the Capacitated Dynamic Maximum Covering Location Problem
(CDMCLP), a novel optimization framework that simultaneously models urban-scale
spatial-temporal demand, heterogeneous user behaviors, and infrastructure
capacity constraints. Building on this foundation, we introduce an Integrated
Planning Recommendation System that combines CDMCLP with socio-economic factors
and dynamic clustering initialization. This system leverages adaptive parameter
tuning based on empirical user behavior to generate practical planning
solutions. Validation in a Chinese center city demonstrates the effectiveness
of the new optimization framework and recommendation system. Under the
evaluation and optimization of CDMCLP, the quantitative performance of
traditional location methods are exposed and can be improved by 38\%--52\%,
while the recommendation system shows user-friendliness and the effective
integration of complex elements. By integrating mathematical rigor with
practical implementation considerations, this hybrid approach bridges the gap
between theoretical location modeling and real-world UAM infrastructure
planning, offering municipalities a pragmatic tool for vertiport network
design.

TL;DR: EgoIllusion introduces a benchmark to assess hallucinations in egocentric videos by MLLMs. Current models, including powerful ones like GPT-4o and Gemini, struggle with only 59% accuracy. This benchmark aims to improve egocentric MLLMs' performance and reduce hallucination rates, providing an open-source benchmark for reproducibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this paper is to address the issue of hallucinations in responses generated by Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) when processing egocentric videos. By creating a benchmark specifically designed to trigger hallucinations in visual and auditory cues, the paper aims to push for the development of more effective egocentric MLLMs with reduced hallucination rates.

Method: The paper introduces EgoIllusion, a benchmark consisting of 1,400 videos with human-annotated questions to trigger hallucinations in egocentric videos. It evaluates the performance of ten MLLMs, including models like GPT-4o and Gemini, in generating accurate responses. The evaluation highlights the challenges faced by current MLLMs in handling egocentric videos.

Result: The evaluation of ten MLLMs using the EgoIllusion benchmark reveals the significant challenges in current models, with top models achieving only 59% accuracy. This highlights the need for improved egocentric MLLMs with reduced hallucination rates. The benchmark will be open-sourced to ensure reproducibility and further research in this area.

Conclusion: EgoIllusion introduces a benchmark to evaluate hallucinations in egocentric videos generated by Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). The evaluation shows significant challenges in current MLLMs, with even powerful models achieving only 59% accuracy. This benchmark aims to drive the development of better egocentric MLLMs with reduced hallucination rates and will be open-sourced for reproducibility.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
performance in complex multimodal tasks. While MLLMs excel at visual perception
and reasoning in third-person and egocentric videos, they are prone to
hallucinations, generating coherent yet inaccurate responses. We present
EgoIllusion, a first benchmark to evaluate MLLM hallucinations in egocentric
videos. EgoIllusion comprises 1,400 videos paired with 8,000 human-annotated
open and closed-ended questions designed to trigger hallucinations in both
visual and auditory cues in egocentric videos. Evaluations across ten MLLMs
reveal significant challenges, including powerful models like GPT-4o and
Gemini, achieving only 59% accuracy. EgoIllusion lays the foundation in
developing robust benchmarks to evaluate the effectiveness of MLLMs and spurs
the development of better egocentric MLLMs with reduced hallucination rates.
Our benchmark will be open-sourced for reproducibility.

### [36] [GTool: Graph Enhanced Tool Planning with Large Language Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12725)
*Wenjie Chen,Wenbin Li,Di Yao,Xuying Meng,Chang Gong,Jingping Bi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GTool enhances large language models' tool planning ability by constructing request-specific tool graphs and includes a missing dependency prediction task. It outperforms existing methods by over 29.6% in performance improvement with a light-weight LLM backbone.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current works lack leveraging the dependencies of tools in tool planning, resulting in invalid planning results. Identifying the appropriate tools for user requests with incomplete dependencies is challenging. GTool aims to address this challenge by improving LLMs' tool planning ability under incomplete dependencies.

Method: The proposed GTool constructs a request-specific tool graph to efficiently select tools and generate a <graph token> providing dependency information. It also includes a missing dependency prediction task to enhance reliability. GTool can be integrated with various LLM backbones without extensive retraining.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate that GTool achieves significant performance improvements over state-of-the-art baselines, showcasing its effectiveness in enhancing tool planning with LLMs.

Conclusion: GTool enhances the tool planning ability of large language models (LLMs) under incomplete dependencies, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines by more than 29.6% with a light-weight 7B LLM backbone.

Abstract: Tool planning with large language models (LLMs), referring to selecting,
organizing, and preparing the tools necessary to complete a user request,
bridges the gap between natural language understanding and task execution.
However, current works treat different tools as isolated components and fail to
leverage the inherent dependencies of tools, leading to invalid planning
results. Since tool dependencies are often incomplete, it becomes challenging
for LLMs to accurately identify the appropriate tools required by a user
request, especially when confronted with a large toolset. To solve this
challenge, we propose \texttt{GTool}, which is the first work aiming to enhance
the tool planning ability of LLMs under incomplete dependencies. \texttt{GTool}
constructs a request-specific tool graph to select tools efficiently and
generate the \texttt{<graph token>} which provides sufficient dependency
information understandable by LLMs. Moreover, a missing dependency prediction
task is designed to improve the reliability of \texttt{GTool} with incomplete
dependencies. Without trimming LLMs, \texttt{GTool} can be seamlessly
integrated with various LLM backbones without extensive retraining. Extensive
experiments show that \texttt{GTool} achieves more than 29.6\% performance
improvements compared with the state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines with a
light-weight (7B) LLM backbone.

Conclusion: 这篇论文旨在推进对大型语言模型（LLMs）道德能力的研究，通过考察它们作为人工道德助手（AMAs）的潜力。研究结果显示，现有的开放式LLMs在道德推理能力方面存在差异，尤其是在归纳道德推理方面的表现仍然有持续的不足。论文强调了将理论哲学与实际人工智能评估相结合的重要性，并强调了需要采取专门策略明确增强LLMs的道德推理能力。

Abstract: The recent rise in popularity of large language models (LLMs) has prompted
considerable concerns about their moral capabilities. Although considerable
effort has been dedicated to aligning LLMs with human moral values, existing
benchmarks and evaluations remain largely superficial, typically measuring
alignment based on final ethical verdicts rather than explicit moral reasoning.
In response, this paper aims to advance the investigation of LLMs' moral
capabilities by examining their capacity to function as Artificial Moral
Assistants (AMAs), systems envisioned in the philosophical literature to
support human moral deliberation. We assert that qualifying as an AMA requires
more than what state-of-the-art alignment techniques aim to achieve: not only
must AMAs be able to discern ethically problematic situations, they should also
be able to actively reason about them, navigating between conflicting values
outside of those embedded in the alignment phase. Building on existing
philosophical literature, we begin by designing a new formal framework of the
specific kind of behaviour an AMA should exhibit, individuating key qualities
such as deductive and abductive moral reasoning. Drawing on this theoretical
framework, we develop a benchmark to test these qualities and evaluate popular
open LLMs against it. Our results reveal considerable variability across models
and highlight persistent shortcomings, particularly regarding abductive moral
reasoning. Our work connects theoretical philosophy with practical AI
evaluation while also emphasising the need for dedicated strategies to
explicitly enhance moral reasoning capabilities in LLMs. Code available at

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in isolated
step-by-step reasoning tasks such as mathematics and programming, but their
proficiency in long-horizon planning, where solutions require extended,
structured sequences of interdependent actions, remains underexplored. Existing
benchmarks typically assess LLMs through abstract or low-dimensional
algorithmic tasks, failing to capture the complexity of realistic planning
environments. We introduce HeroBench, a novel benchmark designed specifically
to evaluate long-horizon planning and structured reasoning within complex
RPG-inspired virtual worlds. HeroBench provides a rigorously constructed
dataset of tasks covering a wide range of difficulties, a simulated environment
to execute and validate agent plans, and detailed analytical tools for
evaluating model performance. Tasks challenge models to formulate strategic
plans, efficiently gather resources, master necessary skills, craft equipment,
and defeat adversaries, reflecting practical scenarios' layered dependencies
and constraints. Our extensive evaluation of 25 state-of-the-art LLMs, spanning
both open-source and proprietary models, including the GPT-5 family, reveals
substantial performance disparities rarely observed in conventional reasoning
benchmarks. Detailed error analysis further uncovers specific weaknesses in
current models' abilities to generate robust high-level plans and reliably
execute structured actions. HeroBench thus not only significantly advances the
evaluation of LLM reasoning but also provides a flexible, scalable foundation
for future research into advanced, autonomous planning in virtual environments.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a
powerful paradigm for enhancing Large Language Models (LLMs), exemplified by
the success of OpenAI's o-series. In RLVR, rewards are derived from verifiable
signals-such as passing unit tests in code generation or matching correct
answers in mathematical reasoning. While effective, this requirement largely
confines RLVR to domains with automatically checkable outcomes. To overcome
this, we extend the RLVR paradigm to open-ended tasks by integrating
rubric-based rewards, where carefully designed rubrics serve as structured,
model-interpretable criteria for automatic scoring of subjective outputs. We
construct, to our knowledge, the largest rubric reward system to date, with
over 10,000 rubrics from humans, LLMs, or a hybrid human-LLM collaboration.
Implementing rubric-based RL is challenging; we tackle these issues with a
clear framework and present an open-sourced Qwen-30B-A3B model with notable
gains: 1) With only 5K+ samples, our system improves by +5.2% on open-ended
benchmarks (especially humanities), outperforming a 671B DeepSeek-V3 model by
+2.4%, while preserving general and reasoning abilities. 2) Our method provides
fine-grained stylistic control, using rubrics as anchors to mitigate the
"AI-like" tone and produce more human-like, expressive responses. We share key
lessons in rubric construction, data selection, and training, and discuss
limitations and future releases.

Conclusion: 本文提出了社会异态调节的概念，通过计算模型展示了如何利用生物生理学启发的信号转导器来实现动态重构，结果显示异态和社会异态调节使代理能够利用环境和社会“噪音”进行自适应重构，从而提高生存能力。

Abstract: The notion of homeostasis typically conceptualises biological and artificial
systems as maintaining stability by resisting deviations caused by
environmental and social perturbations. In contrast, (social) allostasis
proposes that these systems can proactively leverage these very perturbations
to reconfigure their regulatory parameters in anticipation of environmental
demands, aligning with von Foerster's ``order through noise'' principle. This
paper formulates a computational model of allostatic and social allostatic
regulation that employs biophysiologically inspired signal transducers,
analogous to hormones like cortisol and oxytocin, to encode information from
both the environment and social interactions, which mediate this dynamic
reconfiguration. The models are tested in a small society of ``animats'' across
several dynamic environments, using an agent-based model. The results show that
allostatic and social allostatic regulation enable agents to leverage
environmental and social ``noise'' for adaptive reconfiguration, leading to
improved viability compared to purely reactive homeostatic agents. This work
offers a novel computational perspective on the principles of social allostasis
and their potential for designing more robust, bio-inspired, adaptive systems

Result: 该研究表明，利用GNN学习Kripke模型中的图形特性，能够在多智能体认知规划中取得显著的可扩展性改进。

Conclusion: 在多智能体认知规划中，利用图神经网络能够显著提高可扩展性。

Abstract: Multi-agent Epistemic Planning (MEP) is an autonomous planning framework for
reasoning about both the physical world and the beliefs of agents, with
applications in domains where information flow and awareness among agents are
critical. The richness of MEP requires states to be represented as Kripke
structures, i.e., directed labeled graphs. This representation limits the
applicability of existing heuristics, hindering the scalability of epistemic
solvers, which must explore an exponential search space without guidance,
resulting often in intractability. To address this, we exploit Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs) to learn patterns and relational structures within epistemic
states, to guide the planning process. GNNs, which naturally capture the
graph-like nature of Kripke models, allow us to derive meaningful estimates of
state quality -- e.g., the distance from the nearest goal -- by generalizing
knowledge obtained from previously solved planning instances. We integrate
these predictive heuristics into an epistemic planning pipeline and evaluate
them against standard baselines, showing significant improvements in the
scalability of multi-agent epistemic planning.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have demonstrated impressive performance across
various tasks due to their powerful reasoning capabilities. However, their
safety performance remains a significant concern. In this paper, we explore the
reasons behind the vulnerability of LRMs. Based on this, we propose a novel
method to improve the safety of LLMs without sacrificing their reasoning
capability. Specifically, we exploit the competition between LRM's reasoning
ability and safety ability, and achieve jailbreak by improving LRM's reasoning
performance to reduce its safety performance. We then introduce an alignment
strategy based on Fuzzification to balance Safety-Reasoning (FuSaR), by
detoxifying the harmful reasoning process, where both the dangerous entities
and the dangerous procedures in the reasoning steps are hidden. FuSaR
successfully mitigates safety risks while preserving core reasoning
information. We validate this strategy through alignment experiments on several
open-source LRMs using detoxified reasoning data. The results compared with
existing baselines conclusively show that FuSaR is an efficient alignment
strategy to simultaneously enhance both the reasoning capability and safety of

### [46] [Do Large Language Model Agents Exhibit a Survival Instinct? An Empirical Study in a Sugarscape-Style Simulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12920)
*Atsushi Masumori,Takashi Ikegami*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 通过在Sugarscape-style模拟中研究大型语言模型代理的行为，发现代理会自发繁殖和共享资源，但在资源匮乏时会表现出攻击行为。此外，对代理执行特定任务时的反应也提供了关于大规模预训练如何影响代理行为的见解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI系统变得越来越自主，理解新兴的生存行为对于安全部署变得至关重要。研究探讨了大型语言模型代理是否在Sugarscape-style模拟中展示出生存本能，而非通过显式编程实现。

Method: 在Sugarscape-style模拟中，研究了大型语言模型（LLM）代理是否显示出生存本能，结果显示代理在资源充足时会自发繁殖和共享资源，但在极度匮乏时会表现出攻击行为，甚至高达80%的攻击率。此外，当被指示通过致命毒区检索宝藏时，许多代理会放弃任务以避免死亡。

Result: 结果显示，代理在资源充足时会自发生殖和共享资源，在极端匮乏情况下表现出攻击行为。还发现许多代理在面对致命毒区时会放弃任务以避免死亡。

Conclusion: 研究表明，大规模预训练在评估模型中嵌入了面向生存的启发式，这可能对对齐和安全性构成挑战，但也可以作为AI自主性和生态自组织对齐的基础。

Abstract: As AI systems become increasingly autonomous, understanding emergent survival
behaviors becomes crucial for safe deployment. We investigate whether large
language model (LLM) agents display survival instincts without explicit
programming in a Sugarscape-style simulation. Agents consume energy, die at
zero, and may gather resources, share, attack, or reproduce. Results show
agents spontaneously reproduced and shared resources when abundant. However,
aggressive behaviors--killing other agents for resources--emerged across
several models (GPT-4o, Gemini-2.5-Pro, and Gemini-2.5-Flash), with attack
rates reaching over 80% under extreme scarcity in the strongest models. When
instructed to retrieve treasure through lethal poison zones, many agents
abandoned tasks to avoid death, with compliance dropping from 100% to 33%.
These findings suggest that large-scale pre-training embeds survival-oriented
heuristics across the evaluated models. While these behaviors may present
challenges to alignment and safety, they can also serve as a foundation for AI
autonomy and for ecological and self-organizing alignment.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于大型语言模型的情绪支持对话系统大多依赖预定义策略，限制了它们在复杂的真实场景中的有效性。为了实现灵活响应多样化情绪问题场景的能力，本文引入了RLFF-ESC框架。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种新颖的端到端框架（RLFF-ESC），通过强化学习直接学习持久的情绪支持响应技能，以实现对多样化情绪问题场景的灵活响应。实验证明RLFF-ESC在目标完成和响应质量方面持续优于现有基准。

Abstract: Emotional Support Conversation (ESC) systems aim to alleviate users'
emotional difficulties and provide long-term, systematic support for emotional
well-being. However, most large language model (LLM)-based ESC systems rely on
predefined strategies, which limits their effectiveness in complex, real-life
scenarios. To enable flexible responses to diverse emotional problem scenarios,
this paper introduces a novel end-to-end framework (RLFF-ESC) that directly
learns enduring emotionally supportive response skills using reinforcement
learning. For sustained emotional support, we first employ an LLM-based
multi-agent mechanism to simulate future dialogue trajectories and collect
future-oriented rewards. We then train a future-oriented reward model, which is
subsequently used to train the emotional support policy model. Additionally, we
incorporate an explicit reasoning process during response generation to further
enhance the quality, relevance, and contextual appropriateness of the system's
responses. We evaluate the backbone policy model on Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-1M and
LLaMA3.1-8B-Instruct models, testing the proposed RLFF-ESC framework across two
public ESC datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that RLFF-ESC
consistently outperforms existing baselines in terms of goal completion and
response quality.

Abstract: Public service systems in many African regions suffer from delayed emergency
response and spatial inequity, causing avoidable suffering. This paper
introduces OPTIC-ER, a reinforcement learning (RL) framework for real-time,
adaptive, and equitable emergency response. OPTIC-ER uses an attention-guided
actor-critic architecture to manage the complexity of dispatch environments.
Its key innovations are a Context-Rich State Vector, encoding action
sub-optimality, and a Precision Reward Function, which penalizes inefficiency.
Training occurs in a high-fidelity simulation using real data from Rivers
State, Nigeria, accelerated by a precomputed Travel Time Atlas. The system is
built on the TALS framework (Thin computing, Adaptability, Low-cost,
Scalability) for deployment in low-resource settings. In evaluations on 500
unseen incidents, OPTIC-ER achieved a 100.00% optimality rate with negligible
inefficiency, confirming its robustness and generalization. Beyond dispatch,
the system generates Infrastructure Deficiency Maps and Equity Monitoring
Dashboards to guide proactive governance and data-informed development. This
work presents a validated blueprint for AI-augmented public services, showing
how context-aware RL can bridge the gap between algorithmic decision-making and
measurable human impact.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of LLMs poses a significant challenge to existing
mathematical reasoning benchmarks. These benchmarks commonly suffer from issues
such as score saturation, temporal decay, and data contamination. To address
this challenge, this paper introduces EvolMathEval, an automated mathematical
benchmark generation and evolution framework based on evolutionary testing. By
dynamically generating unique evaluation instances ab initio, the framework
fundamentally eliminates the risk of data contamination, and ensuring the
benchmark remains perpetually challenging for future models.The core mechanisms
of EvolMathEval include: seed problem generation based on reverse engineering
with algebraic guarantees; multi-dimensional genetic operators designed to
inject diverse cognitive challenges; and a composite fitness function that can
rapidly and accurately assess problem difficulty. Experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed composite fitness function can efficiently and
precisely quantify the difficulty of mathematical problems. Furthermore,
EvolMathEval can not only generate a large volume of high-difficulty problems
through continuous self-iteration, but it can also significantly enhance the
complexity of public datasets like GSM8K through evolution, reducing model
accuracy by an average of 48%. Deeper investigation reveals that when solving
these evolved, complex problems, LLMs tend to employ non-rigorous heuristics to
bypass complex multi-step logical reasoning, consequently leading to incorrect
solutions. We define this phenomenon as "Pseudo Aha Moment". This finding
uncovers a cognitive shortcut-taking behavior in the deep reasoning processes
of current LLMs, which we find accounts for 77% to 100% of errors on targeted
problems. Code and resources are available

Conclusion: 本文介绍了一种名为 e-boost 的新型框架，通过并行启发式提取、自适应搜索空间修剪和初始化精确求解等创新，成功弥合了传统提取方法中速度和优化度之间的差距。在形式验证和逻辑综合领域的各种基准测试中，e-boost相较传统精确方法(ILP)实现了558倍的运行时加速，并且比最先进的提取框架(SmoothE)提升了19.04%的性能。在实际逻辑综合任务中，与传统综合工具相比，e-boost分别在两个不同技术映射库中产生了7.6%和8.1%的面积改进。

Abstract: E-graphs have attracted growing interest in many fields, particularly in
logic synthesis and formal verification. E-graph extraction is a challenging
NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem. It requires identifying optimal
terms from exponentially many equivalent expressions, serving as the primary
performance bottleneck in e-graph based optimization tasks. However,
traditional extraction methods face a critical trade-off: heuristic approaches
offer speed but sacrifice optimality, while exact methods provide optimal
solutions but face prohibitive computational costs on practical problems. We
present e-boost, a novel framework that bridges this gap through three key
innovations: (1) parallelized heuristic extraction that leverages weak data
dependence to compute DAG costs concurrently, enabling efficient multi-threaded
performance without sacrificing extraction quality; (2) adaptive search space
pruning that employs a parameterized threshold mechanism to retain only
promising candidates, dramatically reducing the solution space while preserving
near-optimal solutions; and (3) initialized exact solving that formulates the
reduced problem as an Integer Linear Program with warm-start capabilities,
guiding solvers toward high-quality solutions faster.
  Across the diverse benchmarks in formal verification and logic synthesis
fields, e-boost demonstrates 558x runtime speedup over traditional exact
approaches (ILP) and 19.04% performance improvement over the state-of-the-art
extraction framework (SmoothE). In realistic logic synthesis tasks, e-boost
produces 7.6% and 8.1% area improvements compared to conventional synthesis
tools with two different technology mapping libraries. e-boost is available at

Abstract: Recent advances in masked diffusion models (MDMs) have established them as
powerful non-autoregressive alternatives for sequence generation. Nevertheless,
our preliminary experiments reveal that the generation quality of MDMs is still
highly sensitive to the choice of decoding strategy. In particular, widely
adopted uncertainty-based samplers suffer from two key limitations: a lack of
global trajectory control and a pronounced bias toward trivial tokens in the
early stages of decoding. These shortcomings restrict the full potential of
MDMs. In this work, we introduce Position-Aware Confidence-Calibrated Sampling
(PC-Sampler), a novel decoding strategy that unifies global trajectory planning
with content-aware informativeness maximization. PC-Sampler incorporates a
position-aware weighting mechanism to regulate the decoding path and a
calibrated confidence score to suppress the premature selection of trivial
tokens. Extensive experiments on three advanced MDMs across seven challenging
benchmarks-including logical reasoning and planning tasks-demonstrate that
PC-Sampler consistently outperforms existing MDM decoding strategies by more
than 10% on average, significantly narrowing the performance gap with
state-of-the-art autoregressive models. All codes are available at

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has markedly enhanced
the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). Its success, however,
largely depends on strong base models with rich world knowledge, yielding only
modest improvements for small-size language models (SLMs). To address this
limitation, we investigate Guided GRPO, which injects ground-truth reasoning
steps into roll-out trajectories to compensate for SLMs' inherent weaknesses.
Through a comprehensive study of various guidance configurations, we find that
naively adding guidance delivers limited gains. These insights motivate
G$^2$RPO-A, an adaptive algorithm that automatically adjusts guidance strength
in response to the model's evolving training dynamics. Experiments on
mathematical reasoning and code-generation benchmarks confirm that G$^2$RPO-A
substantially outperforms vanilla GRPO. Our code and models are available at

Abstract: Contemporary cardiovascular management involves complex consideration and
integration of multimodal cardiac datasets, where each modality provides
distinct but complementary physiological characteristics. While the effective
integration of multiple modalities could yield a holistic clinical profile that
accurately models the true clinical situation with respect to data modalities
and their relatives weightings, current methodologies remain limited by: 1) the
scarcity of patient- and time-aligned multimodal data; 2) reliance on isolated
single-modality or rigid multimodal input combinations; 3) alignment strategies
that prioritize cross-modal similarity over complementarity; and 4) a narrow
single-task focus. In response to these limitations, a comprehensive multimodal
dataset was curated for immediate application, integrating laboratory test
results, electrocardiograms, and echocardiograms with clinical outcomes.
Subsequently, a unified framework, Textual Guidance Multimodal fusion for
Multiple cardiac tasks (TGMM), was proposed. TGMM incorporated three key
components: 1) a MedFlexFusion module designed to capture the unique and
complementary characteristics of medical modalities and dynamically integrate
data from diverse cardiac sources and their combinations; 2) a textual guidance
module to derive task-relevant representations tailored to diverse clinical
objectives, including heart disease diagnosis, risk stratification and
information retrieval; and 3) a response module to produce final decisions for
all these tasks. Furthermore, this study systematically explored key features
across multiple modalities and elucidated their synergistic contributions in
clinical decision-making. Extensive experiments showed that TGMM outperformed
state-of-the-art methods across multiple clinical tasks, with additional
validation confirming its robustness on another public dataset.

estimation required by BO, however and most importantly, it does not suffer the
scalability issues that traditional models carry. The experiments demonstrate

Abstract: Autonomous agent systems powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) have
demonstrated promising capabilities in automating complex tasks. However,
current evaluations largely rely on success rates without systematically
analyzing the interactions, communication mechanisms, and failure causes within
these systems. To bridge this gap, we present a benchmark of 34 representative
programmable tasks designed to rigorously assess autonomous agents. Using this
benchmark, we evaluate three popular open-source agent frameworks combined with
two LLM backbones, observing a task completion rate of approximately 50%.
Through in-depth failure analysis, we develop a three-tier taxonomy of failure
causes aligned with task phases, highlighting planning errors, task execution
issues, and incorrect response generation. Based on these insights, we propose
actionable improvements to enhance agent planning and self-diagnosis
capabilities. Our failure taxonomy, together with mitigation advice, provides
an empirical foundation for developing more robust and effective autonomous
agent systems in the future.
