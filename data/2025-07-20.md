Abstract: The growing ubiquity of artificial intelligence (AI), in particular large
language models (LLMs), has profoundly altered the way in which learners gain
knowledge and interact with learning material, with many claiming that AI
positively influences their learning achievements. Despite this advancement,
current AI tutoring systems face limitations associated with their reactive
nature, often providing direct answers without encouraging deep reflection or
incorporating structured pedagogical tools and strategies. This limitation is
most apparent in the field of mathematics, in which AI tutoring systems remain
underdeveloped. This research addresses the question: How can AI tutoring
systems move beyond providing reactive assistance to enable structured,
individualized, and tool-assisted learning experiences? We introduce a novel
multi-agent AI tutoring platform that combines adaptive and personalized
feedback, structured course generation, and textbook knowledge retrieval to
enable modular, tool-assisted learning processes. This system allows students
to learn new topics while identifying and targeting their weaknesses, revise
for exams effectively, and practice on an unlimited number of personalized
exercises. This article contributes to the field of artificial intelligence in
education by introducing a novel platform that brings together pedagogical
agents and AI-driven components, augmenting the field with modular and
effective systems for teaching mathematics.

Abstract: Enhancing simulation environments to replicate real-world driver behavior,
i.e., more humanlike sim agents, is essential for developing autonomous vehicle
technology. In the context of highway merging, previous works have studied the
operational-level yielding dynamics of lag vehicles in response to a merging
car at highway on-ramps. Other works focusing on tactical decision modeling
generally consider limited action sets or utilize payoff functions with large
parameter sets and limited payoff bounds. In this work, we aim to improve the
simulation of the highway merge scenario by targeting a game theoretic model
for tactical decision-making with improved payoff functions and lag actions. We
couple this with an underlying dynamics model to have a unified decision and
dynamics model that can capture merging interactions and simulate more
realistic interactions in an explainable and interpretable fashion. The
proposed model demonstrated good reproducibility of complex interactions when
validated on a real-world dataset. The model was finally integrated into a high
fidelity simulation environment and confirmed to have adequate computation time
efficiency for use in large-scale simulations to support autonomous vehicle
development.

Abstract: The success of recent Artificial Intelligence (AI) models has been
accompanied by the opacity of their internal mechanisms, due notably to the use
of deep neural networks. In order to understand these internal mechanisms and
explain the output of these AI models, a set of methods have been proposed,
grouped under the domain of eXplainable AI (XAI). This paper focuses on a
sub-domain of XAI, called eXplainable Reinforcement Learning (XRL), which aims
to explain the actions of an agent that has learned by reinforcement learning.
We propose an intuitive taxonomy based on two questions "What" and "How". The
first question focuses on the target that the method explains, while the second
relates to the way the explanation is provided. We use this taxonomy to provide
a state-of-the-art review of over 250 papers. In addition, we present a set of
domains close to XRL, which we believe should get attention from the community.
Finally, we identify some needs for the field of XRL.

### [4] [Fly, Fail, Fix: Iterative Game Repair with Reinforcement Learning and Large Multimodal Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12666)
*Alex Zook,Josef Spjut,Jonathan Tremblay*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: An automated framework combines RL agents and LMMs to refine game mechanics by analyzing player behavior traces, demonstrating the potential for AI-assisted game design tools.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Game design relies on understanding how static rules and content influence dynamic player behavior. Modern generative systems struggle to capture this relationship by only analyzing a game's code or assets.

Method: An automated design iteration framework pairs a reinforcement learning (RL) agent with a large multimodal model (LMM) to revise the game based on the RL player's actions. The RL player produces numerical play metrics and image strips summarizing recent video frames in each loop. The LMM designer analyzes play traces and edits the game configuration to guide future behavior towards the gameplay goal.

Result: The framework successfully integrates RL agents and LMMs to refine game mechanics through behavioral analysis. This approach shows promise in creating AI-assisted game design tools that are practical and scalable.

Conclusion: LMMs can reason over behavioral traces supplied by RL agents to iteratively refine game mechanics, pointing toward practical, scalable tools for AI-assisted game design.

Abstract: Game design hinges on understanding how static rules and content translate
into dynamic player behavior - something modern generative systems that inspect
only a game's code or assets struggle to capture. We present an automated
design iteration framework that closes this gap by pairing a reinforcement
learning (RL) agent, which playtests the game, with a large multimodal model
(LMM), which revises the game based on what the agent does. In each loop the RL
player completes several episodes, producing (i) numerical play metrics and/or
(ii) a compact image strip summarising recent video frames. The LMM designer
receives a gameplay goal and the current game configuration, analyses the play
traces, and edits the configuration to steer future behaviour toward the goal.
We demonstrate results that LMMs can reason over behavioral traces supplied by
RL agents to iteratively refine game mechanics, pointing toward practical,
scalable tools for AI-assisted game design.

### [5] [Benchmarking Deception Probes via Black-to-White Performance Boosts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12691)
*Avi Parrack,Carlo Leonardo Attubato,Stefan Heimersheim*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper evaluates deception probes for detecting deceptive responses from AI assistants by comparing white-box and black-box monitoring. Existing probes show some improvement in performance, indicating potential effectiveness despite not being highly robust against counter strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of the paper is to assess the effectiveness of deception probes in detecting deceptive responses from AI assistants. It aims to determine how well these probes can detect deception in practice and whether they are resistant to counter strategies from deceptive assistants.

Method: The paper compares white-box monitoring (with access to token-level probe activations) to black-box monitoring (without such access) to evaluate the effectiveness of deception probes in detecting deception. The performance is benchmarked based on the black-to-white performance boost.

Result: The paper found that existing deception probes exhibit some level of performance improvement in detecting deceptive responses when white-box monitoring is used. However, the boosts are not significant but still provide a positive outlook on the effectiveness of these probes.

Conclusion: Existing deception probes show weak but encouraging performance boosts in detecting deceptive responses from AI assistants.

Abstract: AI assistants will occasionally respond deceptively to user queries.
Recently, linear classifiers (called "deception probes") have been trained to
distinguish the internal activations of a language model during deceptive
versus honest responses. However, it's unclear how effective these probes are
at detecting deception in practice, nor whether such probes are resistant to
simple counter strategies from a deceptive assistant who wishes to evade
detection. In this paper, we compare white-box monitoring (where the monitor
has access to token-level probe activations) to black-box monitoring (without
such access). We benchmark deception probes by the extent to which the white
box monitor outperforms the black-box monitor, i.e. the black-to-white
performance boost. We find weak but encouraging black-to-white performance
boosts from existing deception probes.

Abstract: In recent years, peer learning has gained attention as a method that promotes
spontaneous thinking among learners, and its effectiveness has been confirmed
by numerous studies. This study aims to develop an AI Agent as a learning
companion that enables peer learning anytime and anywhere. However, peer
learning between humans has various limitations, and it is not always
effective. Effective peer learning requires companions at the same proficiency
levels. In this study, we assume that a learner's peers with the same
proficiency level as the learner make the same mistakes as the learner does and
focus on English composition as a specific example to validate this approach.

Abstract: Human intelligence exhibits a remarkable capacity for rapid adaptation and
effective problem-solving in novel and unfamiliar contexts. We argue that this
profound adaptability is fundamentally linked to the efficient construction and
refinement of internal representations of the environment, commonly referred to
as world models, and we refer to this adaptation mechanism as world model
induction. However, current understanding and evaluation of world models in
artificial intelligence (AI) remains narrow, often focusing on static
representations learned from training on a massive corpora of data, instead of
the efficiency and efficacy of models in learning these representations through
interaction and exploration within a novel environment. In this Perspective, we
provide a view of world model induction drawing on decades of research in
cognitive science on how humans learn and adapt so efficiently; we then call
for a new evaluation framework for assessing adaptive world models in AI.
Concretely, we propose a new benchmarking paradigm based on suites of carefully
designed games with genuine, deep and continually refreshing novelty in the
underlying game structures -- we refer to this kind of games as novel games. We
detail key desiderata for constructing these games and propose appropriate
metrics to explicitly challenge and evaluate the agent's ability for rapid
world model induction. We hope that this new evaluation framework will inspire
future evaluation efforts on world models in AI and provide a crucial step
towards developing AI systems capable of the human-like rapid adaptation and
robust generalization -- a critical component of artificial general
intelligence.

Abstract: In the age of AI, human commanders need to use the computational powers
available in today's environment to simulate a very large number of scenarios.
Within each scenario, situations occur where different decision design options
could have ethical consequences. Making these decisions reliant on human
judgement is both counter-productive to the aim of exploring very large number
of scenarios in a timely manner and infeasible when considering the workload
needed to involve humans in each of these choices. In this paper, we move human
judgement outside the simulation decision cycle. Basically, the human will
design the ethical metric space, leaving it to the simulated environment to
explore the space. When the simulation completes its testing cycles, the
testing environment will come back to the human commander with a few options to
select from. The human commander will then exercise human-judgement to select
the most appropriate course of action, which will then get executed
accordingly. We assume that the problem of designing metrics that are
sufficiently granular to assess the ethical implications of decisions is
solved. Subsequently, the fundamental problem we look at in this paper is how
to weight ethical decisions during the running of these simulations; that is,
how to dynamically weight the ethical attributes when agents are faced with
decision options with ethical implications during generative simulations. The
multi-criteria decision making literature has started to look at nearby
problems, where the concept of entropy has been used to determine the weights
during aggregation. We draw from that literature different approaches to
automatically calculate the weights for ethical attributes during
simulation-based testing and evaluation.

Abstract: Frontier AI systems are rapidly advancing in their capabilities to persuade,
deceive, and influence human behaviour, with current models already
demonstrating human-level persuasion and strategic deception in specific
contexts. Humans are often the weakest link in cybersecurity systems, and a
misaligned AI system deployed internally within a frontier company may seek to
undermine human oversight by manipulating employees. Despite this growing
threat, manipulation attacks have received little attention, and no systematic
framework exists for assessing and mitigating these risks. To address this, we
provide a detailed explanation of why manipulation attacks are a significant
threat and could lead to catastrophic outcomes. Additionally, we present a
safety case framework for manipulation risk, structured around three core lines
of argument: inability, control, and trustworthiness. For each argument, we
specify evidence requirements, evaluation methodologies, and implementation
considerations for direct application by AI companies. This paper provides the
first systematic methodology for integrating manipulation risk into AI safety
governance, offering AI companies a concrete foundation to assess and mitigate
these threats before deployment.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 最近RL在LLMs的数学推理能力中取得进展，但引起了关于真正推理能力的疑问。本论文引入了VAR-MATH符号化评估框架，揭示了现有RL方法在特定数值形式之外推广能力不足，提出了一种污染抗性的数学推理评估范式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于最近RL在LLMs的数学推理能力方面取得了显著进展，但提出了一个基本问题：这些提升是否反映了真正的推理能力，还是仅仅是对基准特定模式的过拟合造成的人工效果？为了回答这个问题，从评估为中心的视角出发，并确定了现有协议中的两个关键缺陷。

Method: 引入了VAR-MATH符号化评估框架，将固定的数值问题转换为符号模板，并要求模型解决每个实例化的多个问题，以确保跨结构等价变体的一致推理表现，从而减轻污染问题并提高评估的鲁棒性。

Result: 通过VAR-MATH对两个流行基准数据集进行符号化转换后，实验结果显示RL训练模型在变量化版本上性能显著下降，揭示了许多现有RL方法依赖表面启发式规则，并无法在特定数值形式之外推广的发现。

Conclusion: 该论文通过引入VAR-MATH符号化评估框架，揭示了许多现有RL方法依赖表面启发式规则，并无法在特定数值形式之外推广的发现。对两种流行基准数据集进行符号化转换后，实验结果显示RL训练模型在变量化版本上性能显著下降，尤其是较小模型，在AMC23上平均下降48.0％，在AIME24上下降58.3％。因此，该论文提出的VAR-MATH为数学推理提供了一种原则性、抗污染的评估范式。

Abstract: Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) have led to substantial
improvements in the mathematical reasoning abilities of large language models
(LLMs), as measured by standard benchmarks. However, these gains often persist
even when models are trained with flawed signals, such as random or inverted
rewards, raising a fundamental question: do such improvements reflect true
reasoning, or are they merely artifacts of overfitting to benchmark-specific
patterns? To address this question, we take an evaluation-centric perspective
and identify two critical shortcomings in existing protocols. First,
\emph{benchmark contamination} arises from the public availability of test
problems, increasing the risk of data leakage. Second, \emph{evaluation
fragility} stems from the reliance on single-instance assessments, which are
highly sensitive to stochastic outputs and fail to capture reasoning
consistency. To overcome these limitations, we introduce {VAR-MATH}, a symbolic
evaluation framework designed to probe genuine reasoning ability. By converting
fixed numerical problems into symbolic templates and requiring models to solve
multiple instantiations of each, VAR-MATH enforces consistent reasoning across
structurally equivalent variants, thereby mitigating contamination and
improving evaluation robustness. We apply VAR-MATH to transform two popular
benchmarks, AMC23 and AIME24, into their symbolic counterparts, VAR-AMC23 and
VAR-AIME24. Experimental results reveal substantial performance drops for
RL-trained models on the variabilized versions, especially for smaller models,
with average declines of 48.0\% on AMC23 and 58.3\% on AIME24. These findings
suggest that many existing RL methods rely on superficial heuristics and fail
to generalize beyond specific numerical forms. Overall, VAR-MATH offers a
principled, contamination-resistant evaluation paradigm for mathematical
reasoning.

Abstract: Probabilistic Event Calculus (PEC) is a logical framework for reasoning about
actions and their effects in uncertain environments, which enables the
representation of probabilistic narratives and computation of temporal
projections. The PEC formalism offers significant advantages in
interpretability and expressiveness for narrative reasoning. However, it lacks
mechanisms for goal-directed reasoning. This paper bridges this gap by
developing a formal translation of PEC domains into Markov Decision Processes
(MDPs), introducing the concept of "action-taking situations" to preserve PEC's
flexible action semantics. The resulting PEC-MDP formalism enables the
extensive collection of algorithms and theoretical tools developed for MDPs to
be applied to PEC's interpretable narrative domains. We demonstrate how the
translation supports both temporal reasoning tasks and objective-driven
planning, with methods for mapping learned policies back into human-readable
PEC representations, maintaining interpretability while extending PEC's
capabilities.

Method tested on optimization problems, assessing computational complexity.

Conclusion: Proposed X-MILP, a domain-agnostic approach for building contrastive explanations for MILPs based on constraint reasoning techniques. Showed how to encode user queries as additional constraints and determine answers through Irreducible Infeasible Subsystem (IIS) computation. Represented explanations as a 'graph of reasons' from IIS, aiding user comprehension. Tested on well-known optimization problems to evaluate computational complexity.

Abstract: Following the recent push for trustworthy AI, there has been an increasing
interest in developing contrastive explanation techniques for optimisation,
especially concerning the solution of specific decision-making processes
formalised as MILPs. Along these lines, we propose X-MILP, a domain-agnostic
approach for building contrastive explanations for MILPs based on constraint
reasoning techniques. First, we show how to encode the queries a user makes
about the solution of an MILP problem as additional constraints. Then, we
determine the reasons that constitute the answer to the user's query by
computing the Irreducible Infeasible Subsystem (IIS) of the newly obtained set
of constraints. Finally, we represent our explanation as a "graph of reasons"
constructed from the IIS, which helps the user understand the structure among
the reasons that answer their query. We test our method on instances of
well-known optimisation problems to evaluate the empirical hardness of
computing explanations.

Abstract: Modern language models address complex questions through chain-of-thought
(CoT) reasoning (Wei et al., 2023) and retrieval augmentation (Lewis et al.,
2021), yet struggle with error propagation and knowledge integration.
Tree-structured reasoning methods, particularly the Probabilistic
Tree-of-Thought (ProbTree)(Cao et al., 2023) framework, mitigate these issues
by decomposing questions into hierarchical structures and selecting answers
through confidence-weighted aggregation of parametric and retrieved knowledge
(Yao et al., 2023). However, ProbTree's static implementation introduces two
key limitations: (1) the reasoning tree is fixed during the initial
construction phase, preventing dynamic adaptation to intermediate results, and
(2) each node requires exhaustive evaluation of all possible solution
strategies, creating computational inefficiency. We present a dynamic
reinforcement learning (Sutton and Barto, 2018) framework that transforms
tree-based reasoning into an adaptive process. Our approach incrementally
constructs the reasoning tree based on real-time confidence estimates, while
learning optimal policies for action selection (decomposition, retrieval, or
aggregation). This maintains ProbTree's probabilistic rigor while improving
both solution quality and computational efficiency through selective expansion
and focused resource allocation. The work establishes a new paradigm for
treestructured reasoning that balances the reliability of probabilistic
frameworks with the flexibility required for real-world question answering
systems.

Abstract: The advancement of powerful yet opaque large language models (LLMs)
necessitates a fundamental revision of the philosophical criteria used to
evaluate artificial moral agents (AMAs). Pre-LLM frameworks often relied on the
assumption of transparent architectures, which LLMs defy due to their
stochastic outputs and opaque internal states. This paper argues that
traditional ethical criteria are pragmatically obsolete for LLMs due to this
mismatch. Engaging with core themes in the philosophy of technology, this paper
proffers a revised set of ten functional criteria to evaluate LLM-based
artificial moral agents: moral concordance, context sensitivity, normative
integrity, metaethical awareness, system resilience, trustworthiness,
corrigibility, partial transparency, functional autonomy, and moral
imagination. These guideposts, applied to what we term "SMA-LLS" (Simulating
Moral Agency through Large Language Systems), aim to steer AMAs toward greater
alignment and beneficial societal integration in the coming years. We
illustrate these criteria using hypothetical scenarios involving an autonomous
public bus (APB) to demonstrate their practical applicability in morally
salient contexts.

Abstract: The combination of higher-order theories and fuzzy logic can be useful in
decision-making tasks that involve reasoning across abstract functions and
predicates, where exact matches are often rare or unnecessary. Developing
efficient reasoning and computational techniques for such a combined formalism
presents a significant challenge. In this paper, we adopt a more
straightforward approach aiming at integrating two well-established and
computationally well-behaved components: higher-order patterns on one side and
fuzzy equivalences expressed through similarity relations based on minimum
T-norm on the other. We propose a unification algorithm for higher-order
patterns modulo these similarity relations and prove its termination,
soundness, and completeness. This unification problem, like its crisp
counterpart, is unitary. The algorithm computes a most general unifier with the
highest degree of approximation when the given terms are unifiable.

Abstract: The evaluation of large language models is a complex task, in which several
approaches have been proposed. The most common is the use of automated
benchmarks in which LLMs have to answer multiple-choice questions of different
topics. However, this method has certain limitations, being the most
concerning, the poor correlation with the humans. An alternative approach, is
to have humans evaluate the LLMs. This poses scalability issues as there is a
large and growing number of models to evaluate making it impractical (and
costly) to run traditional studies based on recruiting a number of evaluators
and having them rank the responses of the models. An alternative approach is
the use of public arenas, such as the popular LM arena, on which any user can
freely evaluate models on any question and rank the responses of two models.
The results are then elaborated into a model ranking. An increasingly important
aspect of LLMs is their energy consumption and, therefore, evaluating how
energy awareness influences the decisions of humans in selecting a model is of
interest. In this paper, we present GEA, the Generative Energy Arena, an arena
that incorporates information on the energy consumption of the model in the
evaluation process. Preliminary results obtained with GEA are also presented,
showing that for most questions, when users are aware of the energy
consumption, they favor smaller and more energy efficient models. This suggests
that for most user interactions, the extra cost and energy incurred by the more
complex and top-performing models do not provide an increase in the perceived
quality of the responses that justifies their use.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究引入了FormulaOne基准测试来评估AI模型在图论、逻辑和算法领域的推理能力。该基准测试设计来测试当前AI模型在解决复杂问题时的局限性，结果显示像OpenAI的o3这样的尖端模型在FormulaOne基准上表现不佳，解决不到1%的问题，突出了AI模型与真正专家水平之间的巨大差距。研究提供了FormulaOne-Warmup，为支持进一步研究和评估提供了一组更简单的任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this paper is to assess the capabilities of frontier AI models in addressing real-life research problems and to bridge the gap between AI expertise and genuine expert-level understanding. By introducing the FormulaOne benchmark, the paper aims to provide a challenging evaluation platform that reflects the complexity of practical optimization problems and theoretical computer science concepts. The goal is to encourage algorithmic progress and research in domains where AI models currently lack expertise.

Method: The paper constructs FormulaOne, a benchmark comprising challenging problems in graph theory, logic, and algorithms to evaluate the reasoning abilities of AI models. The dataset is designed to be commercially relevant and generated from Monadic Second-Order logic on graphs. State-of-the-art models like OpenAI's o3 were tested on FormulaOne, demonstrating their limitations in solving these complex problems. Additionally, FormulaOne-Warmup, a set of simpler tasks from the same distribution, was curated to support further research and evaluation.

Result: The results of the study show that state-of-the-art AI models, exemplified by OpenAI's o3, struggle significantly on the FormulaOne benchmark, solving less than 1% of the questions even with multiple attempts and explanatory examples. This highlights the substantial gap in understanding and problem-solving abilities between AI models and genuine experts in domains that require complex reasoning. The release of FormulaOne-Warmup and the evaluation framework provides a platform for further research and development in this area.

Conclusion: Frontier AI models like OpenAI's o3 struggle to perform well on real-life research problems such as the FormulaOne benchmark, highlighting the gap in expertise between AI models and genuine experts. The paper introduces FormulaOne, a challenging benchmark at the intersection of graph theory, logic, and algorithms, designed to test the reasoning capabilities of AI models. The dataset is commercially relevant, generated from Monadic Second-Order logic on graphs, and is closely linked to theoretical computer science and central conjectures like the Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis (SETH). The results indicate the limitations of current AI models on complex problems that require in-depth reasoning.

Abstract: Frontier AI models demonstrate formidable breadth of knowledge. But how close
are they to true human -- or superhuman -- expertise? Genuine experts can
tackle the hardest problems and push the boundaries of scientific
understanding. To illuminate the limits of frontier model capabilities, we turn
away from contrived competitive programming puzzles, and instead focus on
real-life research problems.
  We construct FormulaOne, a benchmark that lies at the intersection of graph
theory, logic, and algorithms, all well within the training distribution of
frontier models. Our problems are incredibly demanding, requiring an array of
reasoning steps. The dataset has three key properties. First, it is of
commercial interest and relates to practical large-scale optimisation problems,
such as those arising in routing, scheduling, and network design. Second, it is
generated from the highly expressive framework of Monadic Second-Order (MSO)
logic on graphs, paving the way toward automatic problem generation at scale;
ideal for building RL environments. Third, many of our problems are intimately
related to the frontier of theoretical computer science, and to central
conjectures therein, such as the Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis (SETH). As
such, any significant algorithmic progress on our dataset, beyond known
results, could carry profound theoretical implications.
  Remarkably, state-of-the-art models like OpenAI's o3 fail entirely on
FormulaOne, solving less than 1% of the questions, even when given 10 attempts
and explanatory fewshot examples -- highlighting how far they remain from
expert-level understanding in some domains. To support further research, we
additionally curate FormulaOne-Warmup, offering a set of simpler tasks, from
the same distribution. We release the full corpus along with a comprehensive
evaluation framework.
